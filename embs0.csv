"""""""1. Forex Trading – IntroductionFo rex TradingForex Market is an exciting place. The one good thing about entering into the forex marketis that you can trade anytime as per your convenience.The global Foreign exchange market (‘FX’, ‘Forex’ or ‘FOREX’) is the largest market in theworld as measured by the daily turnover with more than US$5 trillion a day eclipsing thecombined turnover of the world’s stock and bond markets. The forex market measuring apropelling turnover is one of the many reasons why so many private investors andindividual traders have entered the market. The investors have discovered severaladvantages many of which are not available in the other markets.What is Forex?Forex (in simple terms, currency) is also called the foreign exchange, FX or currencytrading. It is a decentralized global market where all the world’s currencies trade with eachother. It is the largest liquid market in the world.The liquidity (more buyers and sellers) and competitive pricing (the spread is very smallbetween bid and ask price) available in this marked are great. With the irregularity in theperformance in other markets, the growth of forex trading, investing and management isin upward trajectory.Why Trade Forex?So, why trade Forex? There are many reasons to trade in Forex. If we ask four differentpeople, you might get more than four different answers. Primarily, making money is themost frequently cited reason for why trade Forex.Let us now consider the following reasons why so many people are choosing forex market:Forex market never sleepsThe Forex market works 24 hours and 5-1/2 days a week. Because governments,corporates and private individual who require currency exchange services are spreadaround the world, so trading on the forex market never stops. Activity on the forex marketfollows the sun around the world, so right from the Monday morning opening in Australia"""""""
"""""""around the world, so trading on the forex market never stops. Activity on the forex marketfollows the sun around the world, so right from the Monday morning opening in Australiato the afternoon close in New York. At any point of the day you can find an active pair totrade.Long or ShortA trader in forex can trade both ways. It means a forex trader can play the market andmake profits irrespective of whether market is going up, down or is in tight range. Soirrespective of the event that has triggered the movement – forex traders do not care.Low transaction costMost forex accounts trade with little or no commission and there is no exchange or datalicense fees. Generally, the retail transaction fee (the bid/ask spread) is typically less than2"""""""
"""""""Forex Trading0.1% under normal market conditions. With larger dealers (where volumes are huge), thespread could be as low as 0.05%. Leverage plays a crucial role here.LeverageLeverage is the mechanism by which a trader can take position much larger than the initialinvestment. Leverage is one more reason why you should trade in forex. Few currencytraders realize the advantage of financial leverage available to them. For example, if youare trading in equity market, the maximum leverage a stock broker is offered is 1:2 butin case of forex market, you will get a leverage up to 1:50 and in many parts of the worldeven higher leverage is available. For this reason, it is not hard to see that why forextrading is so popular.High leverage allows a trader with small investment to trade higher volumes of currenciesand thus provide the opportunity to make significant profits from the small movement inthe market. However, if the market is against your assumption you might lose significantamount too. Therefore, like any other market, it is a two-way sword.High LiquidityThe size of forex market is enormous and liquid by nature. High liquidity means a tradercan trade with any type of currency. Timing is not a constraint as well; trading can bedone as per your convenience. The buyers and sellers across the world accept differenttypes of currencies. In addition, forex market is active 24 hours a day and is closed onlyon the weekends.AccessibilityGetting started as a currency trader would not cost a ton of money especially whencompared to trading stocks, option or future market. We have online forex brokers offering“mini” or “micro” trading accounts that let you open a trading account with a minimumaccount deposit of $25.

However, it does not mean it isalways active. Let us check what a 24-hour day in the forex world looks like.The forex market is divided into four major trading sessions: the Sydney session, theTokyo session, the London session and the New York session.Forex Market HoursThe following table shows the opening and closing time of each session.3"""""""

Forex Trading – The structure of thFeore xf oTrardeingxmarketIn this chapter, we will learn about the structure of the forex market.The structure of a typical stock market is as shown below:CentralisedBuyers SellerExchanges (NSE,B SE, NYSE )But the structure of the forex market is rather unique because major volumes oftransactions are done in Over-The-Counter (OTC) market which is independent of anycentralized system (exchange) as in the case of stock markets.The participants in this market are: Central Banks Major commercial banks Investment banks Corporations for international business transactions Hedge funds Speculators Pension and mutual funds Insurance companies Forex brokers5"""""""

The participants of thismarket trade either directly with each other or electronically through the ElectronicBrokering Services (EBS) or the Reuters Dealing 3000-Spot Matching.The competition between the two companies – The EBS and the Reuters 3000-SpotMatching in forex market is similar to Pepsi and Coke in the consumer market.Some of the largest banks like HSBC, Citigroup, RBS, Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas,Barclays Bank among others determine the FX rates through their operations. These largebanks are the key players for global FX transactions. The banks have the true overallpicture of the demand and supply in the overall market, and have the current scenario ofany current. The size of their operations effectively lay down the bid-ask spread thattrickles down to the lower end of the pyramid.The next tier of participants are the non-bank providers such as retail market makers,brokers, ECNs, hedge funds, pension and mutual funds, corporations, etc. Hedge fundsand technology companies have taken significant chunk of share in retail FX but very lessfoothold in corporate FX business.

"""""""Forex Tradingor finished products. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) also create significant demand andsupply of currencies.Sometimes, governments and centralized banks like the RBI (in India) also intervene inthe Foreign Exchange market to stop too much volatility in the currency market. Forinstance, to support the pricing of rupees, the government and centralized banks buyrupees from the market and sell in different currencies such as dollars; conversely, toreduce the value of Indian rupees, they sell rupees and buy foreign currency (dollars).The speculators and retail traders that come at the bottom of the pyramid pay the largestspread, because their trades effectively get executed through two layers. The primarypurpose of these players are to make money trading the fluctuations in the currency prices.With the advancement of technology and internet, even a small trader can participate inthis huge forex market.Currency pairIf you are new to the forex market and have just started trading Forex online, you mayfind yourself overwhelmed and confused both at a time by the huge number of availablecurrency pairs inside your terminal (like the MetaTrader4, etc.). So what are the bestcurrency pairs to trade? The answers is not that straightforward as it varies with eachtrader and its terminal window or with what exchange (or OTC market) he is trading.Instead, you need to take the time to analyse different pairs of currencies against yourown strategy to determine the best forex pairs to trade on your accounts.The trade in Forex market occurs between two currencies, because one currency is beingbought (buyer/bid) and another sold (seller/ask) at the same time. There is aninternational code that specifies the setup of currency pairs we can trade. For example, aquote of EUR/USD 1.25 means that one Euro is worth $1.25.

Here, the base currency isthe Euro(EUR), and the counter currency is the US dollar.Commonly Used Currency PairIn this section, we will learn about a few commonly used currency pair.The most traded, dominant and strongest currency is the US dollar. The primary reasonfor this is the size of the US economy, which is the world’s largest. The US dollar is thepreferred base or reference currency in most of the currency exchange transactionsworldwide. Below are some of the most traded (high liquidity) currency pairs in the globalforex market. These currencies are part of most of the foreign exchange transactions.However, this is not necessarily the best currency to trade for every trader, as this (whichcurrency pair to choose) depends on multiple factors: EUR/USD (Euro – US Dollar) GBP/USD (British Pound – US Dollar) USD/JPY (US Dollar – Japanese Yen) USD/CHF ( US Dollar – Swiss Franc) EUR/JPY ( Euro – Japanese Yen) USD/CAD (US Dollar – Canadian Dollar) AUD/USD (Australian Dollar – US Dollar)7"""""""
"""""""Forex TradingAs prices of these major currencies keep changing and so do the values of the currencypairs change. This leads to a change in trade volumes between two countries. These pairsalso represent countries that have financial power and are traded heavily worldwide. Thetrading of these currencies makes them volatile during the day and the spread tends tobe lower.EUR/USD Currency PairThe EUR/USD currency pair is considered to be the most popular currency pair and hasthe lowest spread among modern world forex brokers. This is also the most tradedcurrency pair in the world. About 1/3rd of all the trade in the market is done in this currencypair. Another important point is that this forex pair is not too volatile. Therefore, if you donot have that much risk appetite you can consider this currency pair to trade.The following diagram shows some of the major currency pairs and their values:Note: The above currency pair quotes were taken from www.finance.google.com.8"""""""
"""""""Forex TradingThe Bid-Ask SpreadThe spread is the difference between the bid price and the ask price. The bid price is therate at which you can sell a currency pair and the ask price is the rate at which you canbuy a currency pair (EUR/USD).Whenever you try to trade any currency pair, you will notice that there are two pricesshown, as shown in the image below:The following image shows the spread between USD and INR (US Dollar – Indian Rupees)pair.Bid Price Ask Price(Source: Above data is taken from nseindia.com)The lower price (67.2600 in our example) is called the “Bid” and it is the price at yourbroker (through which you’re trading) is willing to pay for buying the base currency (USDin this example) in exchange for the counter currency (INR in our case). Inversely, if youwant to open a short trade (sell), you will do so at the price of 67.2625 in our example.The higher price (67.2625) is called the ‘Ask’ price and it is the price at which the brokeris willing to sell you the base currency (USD) against the counter currency (INR).What are Bullish and Bearish Markets?The term “bull” (bullish) and “bear” (bearish”) are often used to describe how the overallfinancial market is performing in general – whether there is an appreciation ordepreciation. Simply put, a bull (bullish) market is used to describe conditions where9"""""""
"""""""Forex Tradingmarket is rising and a bear (bearish) market is the one where market is going down. It isnot, a single day which describes if the market is in bullish or bearish form; it is a coupleof weeks or months which tell us if the market is in the bull(bullish) or the bear(bearish)grip.What happens in a Bull Market?In a bull market, the confidence of the investor or the traders is high. There is optimismand positive expectations that good results will continue. So in all, bull market occurs whenthe economy is performing well – unemployment is low, GDP is high and stocks marketsarerising.The bull market is generally related with the equity (stock) market but it applies to allfinancial markets like currencies, bonds, commodities, etc. Therefore, during a bull marketeverything in the economy looks great - the GDP is growing, there is less unemployment,the equity prices are rising, etc.All this leads to rises not only in stock market but also in FX currencies such as AustralianDollar (AUD), New Zealand Dollar (NZD), Canadian Dollar (CAD) and emerging marketcurrencies. Conversely, the bull market generally leads to a decline in safe-havencurrencies such as US dollar, the Japanese yen or the Swiss franc (CHF).Why does it Matter to You?Forex trading is always done in pairs, where if one currency is weakening the other isstrengthening. As you can trade both ways means you can take a long (buy) or short (sell)view in either currency pair, thereby allowing you to take advantage of rising and fallingmarkets.In forex market, bull and bear trends also determine which currency is stronger and whichis not. By correctly understanding the market trends, a trader can make proper decisionsof how to manage risk and gain a better understanding of when it is best to enter and exitfrom your trades.What happens in a Bear Market?A bear market denotes a negative trend in the market as the investor sells riskier assets"""""""

Thechances of loss are far greater because prices are continually losing value. Investor ortraders are better off short-selling or moving to safer investments like gold or fixed-incomesecurities.In a bearish market, investor generally moves to safe-haven currencies like Japanese Yen(JPY) and US Dollar (USD) and sold off riskier instruments.Why does it Matter to You?Because a trader can earn great profit during bull and bear market considering you aretrading with the trend. As forex trading is always done in pairs, buy the strength and sellthe weak should be your trade.10"""""""
"""""""Forex TradingWhat is Lot size?Let us now learn what a lot size is.A lot is a unit to measure the amount of the deal. Your value of your trade alwayscorresponds to an integer number of lots (lot size * number of lots).Trading with the proper position or lot size on each trade is key to successful forex trading.The position size refers to how many lots (micro, mini or standard) you take on a particulartrade.The standard size for a lot is 100,000 units of base currency in a forex trade, and now wehave mini, micro and nano lot sizes that are 10,000, 1,000 and 100 units respectively.What is long in forex trade?Whenever you purchase (buy) a currency pair, it is called going long. When a currencypair is long, the first currency is purchased (indicating, you are bullish) while the secondis sold short (indicating, you are bearish).For example, if you are purchasing a EUR/INR currency pair, you expect that the price ofEuro will go high and the price of Indian rupees (INR) will go down.What is short in forex trade?When you go short on a forex, the first currency is sold while the second currency isbought. To go short on a currency means you sell it hoping that its prices will decline infuture.In forex trade, whether you are making “long” (buying a currency pair) or “short” (sellinga currency pair) trades, you are always long on one currency and short on another.Therefore, if you sell, or go short on USD/INR, then you are long on INR and short onUSD. It means you expect the prices of INR (Indian rupees) will rise and the price of theUSD (US dollar) will fall.What are Pending Orders in Forex Trade?A pending order in any trade is an order that was not yet executed thus not yet becominga trade. Generally, while trading we place the order with a limit, means our order (pendingtrade) will not get executed if the price of a financial instrument does not reach a certainpoint."""""""

Pending order willautomatically get executed once price reaches to the pending order position. The followingare the four types of pending order:Buy LimitA pending order to buy a currency at a lower price (whatever price trader wants to buy)than the current one.11"""""""

Leverage meanshaving the ability to control a large amount of money using very little amount of your ownmoney and borrowing the rest.For example, to trade a $10,000 position (traded value of security); your broker wants$100 from your account. Your leverage, which is expressed in ratios, is now 100:1.In short, with mere $100, you are controlling $10,000.Therefore, if during the trade $10,000 investment rises in value to $10,100, it means arise in $100. Because you are leveraged 100:1, your actual amount invested is $100 andyour gain is $100. This in turn your return to a groovy 100%.In such case, the trade goes in your favor. What if, you have ended up with a -1% return($10,000 position). -100% return using 100:1 leverage.Therefore, risk management of leverage position is very important for every trader orinvestor.What is Margin?Margin is the amount of money your trading account (or broker needs) should have as a“good faith deposit” to open any position with your broker.So consider the leverage example in which we are able to take position of $100,000 withan initial deposit amount of $1000.This $1000 deposit amount is called “margin” you had to give in order to initiate a tradeand use leverage.Your broker to maintain your position uses it. The broker collects margin money from eachof its client (customer) and uses this “super margin deposit” to be able to place trades"""""""
"""""""and use leverage.Your broker to maintain your position uses it. The broker collects margin money from eachof its client (customer) and uses this “super margin deposit” to be able to place tradeswithin the interbank network.12"""""""
"""""""Forex TradingMargin is expressed as a percentage of the full amount of the position. Your margin mayvary from 10% to .25% margin. Based on the margin required by your broker, you cancalculate the maximum leverage you can yield with your trading account.For example, if your broker required 5% margin, you have the leverage of 20:1 and ifyour margin is 0.25%, you can have leverage of 400:1.HedgingHedging is basically a strategy which is intended to reduce possible risks in case pricesmovement against your trade. We can think of it with something like “insurance policy”which protects us from particular risk (consider your trade here).To protect against a loss from a price fluctuation in future, you usually open an offsettingposition in a related security. Traders and investors usually use hedging when they arenot sure which way the market will be heading. Ideally, hedging reduces risks to almostzero, and you end up paying only the broker's fee.A trader can utilize hedging in the following two ways:To open a position in an off-setting instrumentThe offsetting instrument is a related security to your initial position. This allows you tooffset some of the potential risks of your position while not depriving you of your profitpotential completely. One of the classic example would be to go long say an airlinecompany and simultaneously going long on crude oil. As these two sector are inverselyrelated, a rise in crude oil prices will likely cause your airline long position to suffer somelosses but your crude oil long helps offset part or all of that loss. If the oil prices remainsteady, you may profit from the airline long while breaking even on your oil position. Ifthe prices of oil goes down, the oil long will give you losses but the airline stock willprobably rise and mitigate some or all your losses. So hedging helps to eliminate not allbut some of your risks while trading."""""""
"""""""the prices of oil goes down, the oil long will give you losses but the airline stock willprobably rise and mitigate some or all your losses. So hedging helps to eliminate not allbut some of your risks while trading.To buy and/or sell derivative (future/forward/option) of some sort in order to reduce yourportfolio’s risk as well as reward exposure, as opposed to liquidating some of your currentpositions. This strategy may come handy where you do not want to directly trade withyour portfolio for a while due to some market risks or uncertainties, but you rather notliquidate part or all of it for other reasons. In this type of hedging, the hedge isstraightforward and can be calculated precisely.Stop LossesA stop-loss is an order placed in your trading terminal to sell a security when it reaches aspecific price. The primary goal of a stop loss is to mitigate an investor’s loss on a positionin a security (Equity, FX, etc.). It is commonly used with a long position but can be appliedand is equally profitable for a short position. It comes very handy when you are not ableto watch the position.Stop-losses in Forex is very important for many reasons. One of the main reason thatstands out is no one can predict the future of the forex market every time correctly. Thefuture prices are unknown to the market and every trade entered is a risk.Forex traders can set stops at one fixed price with an expectation of allocating the stop-loss and wait until the trade hits the stop or limit price.13"""""""
"""""""Forex TradingStop-loss not only helps you in reducing your loss (in case trade goes against your bet)but also helps in protecting your profit (in case trade goes with the trend). For example,the current USD/INR rate is 66.25 and there is an announcement by the US federalchairperson on whether there will be a rate hike or not.

Forex Trading – Major Currencies anFodrex TTrradaingd eSystemsThe forex currencies of a country are influenced by a series of macro-economic conditionsas well as the world’s economic situation. Macro indicators like Economic indicators (GDPgrowth, imports/exports), social factors (the unemployment rate, country infra-structureor real estate market conditions) and the country central bank’s (like RBI in india) policiesare the key factors that determine the value of a currency on the foreign exchange market.Major CurrenciesIn this section, we will learn about the distinct features of six major currencies.The US DollarThe US Dollar dominates the world foreign exchange market heavily. The US Dollar is thebase or universal currency to evaluate any other currency traded on forex. Almost allcurrencies are generally quoted in US dollar terms.The US dollar currently represents about 86% of all foreign exchange market transactions.Most commodities (metals, oil etc.) are traded with prices denominated in US Dollars; asa result, any fluctuations in supply and demand of these commodities have direct impacton the value of US Dollar. This happened in 2008 financial crisis when oil prices collapsedand the EUR/USD climbed to 1.60.As US dollar is considered as the safe-haven currency. Therefore, investors move towardsthe dollar when economic conditions deteriorate.The Euro (EUR)The Euro is the second most dominating currency in the forex market. Like the US Dollar,the Euro also has a strong international acceptance streaming from the members of theEuropean Monetary Union.The Euro is used by 18 member countries of the European Union and is currently accountedfor almost 37% of all forex transactions.The main factors that influence the acceptance of Euro’s prices are often based on well-established economies (developed countries) that use the common currency, such asFrance and Germany.

Thisrestricts the dominance of Euro in the global forex market. In the event of problems, EUleaders have a hard time finding common solutions that are beneficial to both the largeand small economies.The Japanese Yen (JPY)The Japanese yen is the most traded and dominating currency in the Asian forex market.It is the third most popular or traded currency in the forex market and represents almost15"""""""

The Japanese stockmarket, .i.e., the Nikkei index and real estate market correlate with the volatility of theJapanese yen (JPY).Because the Japanese economy is mostly an industrial exports economy, the Japanesecurrency (JPY) among traders and investors is considered as a safe-haven currency inperiods when risk aversion hits the market. Low interest rates in Japan allows traders toborrow at low cost and invest in other countries.The JPY’s currency risks are related to the constant devaluation of the currency and theinterventions of the country’s central bank. Because japan is an export oriented economy,the central bank is constantly trying to weaken its currency.The British Pound (GBP)The British Pound is the UK’s currency. Until the end of World War II, the pound continuedto have the same dominance in forex market what is US dollar today and was the currencyof reference. The currency (GBP) is heavily traded against the euro and the US dollar buthas less presence against other currencies.The British Pound (GBP) is the fourth most traded currency internationally and about 17%of all transaction is done through GBP in global forex market. Because London is consideredas the forex market hub globally, 34% of all forex transaction pass through London City.The fundamental factors that affect the pound are as complex and varied as the Britisheconomy and its influence on the world. Inflation, country GDP and the housing marketinfluence the pound value.Forex traders sometimes use the pound as an alternative to the euro especially when theEuropean Union’s problems become too bad.The Swiss Franc (CHF)The Swiss Franc is the currency and legal tender of Switzerland.

Though the size of the Swiss economy isrelatively small, the Swiss franc is one of the four major currencies traded in the forexmarket, closely resembling the strength and quality of the Swiss economy and finance.The CHF is also considered as the safe-haven currency and investors move towards itduring periods of risk aversion: the Swiss economy and its foreign reserves mainly gold(7th largest reserve in the world) add to the currency’s credibility.The CHF prices depend on the central bank policy. The CHF tends to be more volatilecompared to other major currencies due to lack of liquidity.The Canadian Dollar (CAD)The CAD is a commodity driven currency.

The commonlyfollowed trading systems in the forex market are described below:Trading with brokersThe foreign exchange broker or the forex broker also known as the currency-trading brokerunlike the equity or commodity brokers does not hold positions. The main role of thesebrokers is to serve banks. They act as intermediaries to buy and sell currencies atcommissioned rates.Before the dawn of Internet, a majority of the FX brokers executed orders via phone usingan open box system. There was a microphone in the broker desk that continuouslytransmitted all that he communicated on the direct phone lines to the speaker’s boxes inthe banks. This way, banks also received all the business orders.In an open box system used by brokers, a trader is able to hear all the prices quoted;whether the bid was executed or the offer (ask) taken; and the price that followed. Whatis hidden from the trader is the amounts of particular bids and offers and the names ofthe banks showing the prices. The prices were confidential, and the buyers and sellerswere anonymous.In this age of Internet, many brokers have allowed clients to access their accounts andtrade through electronic platform (mostly through their proprietary software) andcomputer applications.Direct DealingDirect dealing is based on the economy of mutuality. All participants in the currency market– a bank, establishing a price, thinks that the other bank that has turned to it will replywith mutuality, establishing its own price, when they turn to the bank.

The factors may also include various geo-political aspects that may impact the price movement of a currency pair.This analysis is not used to get the specific numbers for the exchange rates of variouscurrencies. Instead, it helps in determining the trend of the forex spot market over acertain period.If the fundamental analysis hints at a positive outlook for a particular currency pair, itindicates that the price of that pair would experience an upward trajectory movement inthe near future.

On the other hand, Technical Analysis provides information for short-termpredictions.The market’s momentum can easily reverse or an extreme volatility can be seen in amatter of minutes after an important announcement or press release is made by thecentral bank. Information related to the status of the local and global economies can havehuge impact on the direction in which the forex market trends.Key factors influencing fundamental analysisLet us now learn about the key factors that influence fundamental analysis. The factorsare described below in brief:Interest RatesThe interest rates set by the central bank is one of the most important factors in decidingthe price movement of currency pairs. A high interest rate increases the attractiveness ofa country’s currency and also attracts forex investors towards buying.GDP GrowthA high GDP growth rate signifies an increase in the total wealth of the country. This pointstowards the strengthening of the country’s currency and its value rises relative to otherforeign currencies.Industrial ProductionA high industrial growth in any country signifies a robust country economy. A country withrobust economy encourages forex traders to invest in country forex currency.Consumer Price Index (CPI)The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is directly proportional to the prices of goods and servicesin the country. If the CPI index is too high (above the central bank benchmark of CPI),there is a high probability that central bank is most likely to lower interest rates to bringdown the rate of inflation and stabilize the growth rate for the country’s economy.Retail SalesA country’s retail sales data gives an accurate picture of how people are spending (people"""""""

These chartsrepresent the price movements of currencies over a certain period preceding exchangedeals, as well as technical indicators. The technical indicators are obtained throughmathematical processing of averaged and other characteristics of price movements.Technical Analysis (TA) is based on the concept that a person can look at historical pricemovements (for example currency) and determine the current trading conditions andpotential price movement.Dow Theory for Technical AnalysisThe fundamental principles of technical analysis are based on the Dow Theory with thefollowing main assumptions:Price discounts everythingPrice is a comprehensive reflection of all the market forces. At any point of time, all marketinformation and forces are reflected in the currency price (“The Market knowseverything”).Prices usually move in the direction of the trendPrice movements are usually trend followers. There is a very common saying amongtraders – “Trend is your friend”.Trends are classified as – Up trends (Bullish pattern) Down trends (Bearish pattern) Flat trends (sideways pattern)Price movements are historically repetitive. This results in similar behavior of patterns onthe charts.Sentimental AnalysisThe participants in every market, the traders and the investors have their own opinion ofwhy the market is acting the way it does and whether to trade in the direction of market(towards market trends) or go against it (taking contrary bet).The traders and investors come with their own thoughts and opinions on the market.

Forex trading strategies help yougain an insight of the market movements and make moves accordingly.

In order toplay their role efficiently, it is necessary that their operations/dealings be trustworthy.Trustworthy is concerned with contractual obligations being honored. For example, if twoparties have entered into forward contract of a currency pair (means one is purchasingand the other is selling), both of them should be willing to honor their side of contract asthe case may be.Following are the major foreign exchange markets: Spot Markets Forward Markets Future Markets Option Markets Swaps MarketsSwaps, Future and Options are called the derivative because they derive their value fromthe underlying exchange rates.Spot MarketThese are the quickest transactions involving currency in the foreign exchange market.This market provides immediate payment to the buyers and sellers as per the currentexchange rate.

Commercial and investment banks arethe main players of the foreign exchange market; they not only trade on their own behalfbut also for their customers. A major chunk of the trade comes by trading in currenciesindulged by the bank to gain from exchange movements. Interbank transaction is done incase the transaction volume is huge. For small volume intermediation of foreign exchange,a broker may be sought.Central banksCentral banks like RBI in India (RBI) intervene in the market to reduce currencyfluctuations of the country currency (like INR, in India) and to ensure an exchange ratecompatible with the requirements of the national economy. For example, if rupee showssigns of depreciation, RBI (central bank) may release (sell) a certain amount of foreigncurrency (like dollar). This increased supply of foreign currency will halt the depreciationof rupee. The reverse operation may be done to halt rupee from appreciating too much.Dealers, brokers, arbitrageurs and speculatorsDealers are involved in buying low and selling high. The operations of these dealers arefocused towards wholesale and a majority of their transactions are interbank in nature. Attimes, the dealers may have to deal with corporates and central banks. They have lowtransaction costs as well as very thin spread. Wholesale transactions account for 90percent of the overall value of the foreign exchange deals.Forward MarketIn forward contract, two parties (two companies, individual or government nodal agencies)agree to do a trade at some future date, at a stated price and quantity.

There are speculators, who based on their knowledge or information forecastan increase in price. They then go long (buy) on the forward market instead of the cashmarket. Now this speculator would go long on the forward market, wait for the price torise and then sell it at higher prices; thereby, making a profit.Disadvantages of forward marketsThe forward markets come with a few disadvantages. The disadvantages are describedbelow in brief: Lack of centralization of trading Illiquid (because only two parties are involved) Counterparty risk (risk of default is always there)24"""""""
"""""""Forex TradingIn the first two issues, the basic problem is that there is a lot of flexibility and generality.The forward market is like two persons dealing with a real estate contract (two partiesinvolved - the buyer and the seller) against each other. Now the contract terms of the dealis as per the convenience of the two persons involved in the deal, but the contracts maybe non-tradeable if more participants are involved. Counterparty risk is always involved inforward market; when one of the two parties of the transaction chooses to declarebankruptcy, the other suffers.Another common problem in forward market is - the larger the time period over which theforward contract is open, the larger are the potential price movements, and hence thelarger is the counter-party risk involved.Even in case of trade in forward markets, trade have standardized contracts, and henceavoid the problem of illiquidity but the counterparty risk always remains.Future MarketsThe future markets help with solutions to a number of problems encountered in forwardmarkets. Future markets work on similar lines as the forward markets in terms of basicphilosophy. However, contracts are standardized and trading is centralized (on a stockexchange like NSE, BSE, KOSPI). There is no counterparty risk involved as exchanges haveclearing corporation, which becomes counterparty to both sides of each transaction andguarantees the trade. Future market is highly liquid as compared to forward markets asunlimited persons can enter into the same trade (like, buy FEB NIFTY Future).Option MarketBefore we learn about the option market, we need to understand what an Option is.What is an option?An option is a contract, which gives the buyer of the options the right but not the obligationto buy or sell the underlying at a future fixed date (and time) and at a fixed price.

Lot sizes differ brokerto broker - standard lot, mini lot, micro lot or even nano lots.

Thus, by plotting a currency pair price over aperiod of time (time frame), we end up with a pictorial representation of any asset (stock,commodity or FX) trading history.A chart can also represent the history of the volume of trading in an asset.

"""""""Forex TradingBar ChartBar chart is a commonly used type of chart by technical analysts. It is called bar chartbecause each day’s range is represented by a vertical bar.Although daily bar charts are best known, bar charts can be created for any period –weekly, monthly and yearly for example. A bar shows the high price for the period at thetop and the lowest price at the bottom of the bar. Lines on either side of the vertical barserve to mark the opening and closing prices of an asset (stock, currency pair). A smalltick on the left side of the bar shows the opening price and a tick to the right of the barshows closing price.34Forex TradingMany traders work with bar charts created over a matter of minutes during a day’s trading.Following is a 5-Day Bar chart of USDINR in 5 minutes interval.35Forex TradingWith 1-Day interval, 1-month chart of USDINR will be shown like this:Candlesticks ChartThe candlesticks chart is very popular among the traders community. This chart providesvisual insight to current market psychology. A candlestick displays the open, high, low andclosing price of a security very similar to a modern-day bar chart, but in a manner thatmitigates the relationship between the opening and closing prices. Each candlestickrepresents one time frame (e.g., day) of data. The figure given below displays variouselements of a candle.Elements of a CandleA candlestick chart can be created using the data of High, Open, Low and Closing pricesfor each time period that you want to display. The middle portion (filled portion) of thecandlestick is called “the body (“the real body”). The long thin lines above and below thebody represent the high/low range and are called “shadows” (sometimes called “wicks”and “tails”).The body of the candlestick represents a stock’s opening and closing price of the security(stock or currency pair).36"""""""

Forex Trading – Pattern Study of TFroreexn Trdadisng,Support and ResistanceIn technical analysis, support and resistance represent the critical point where the forcesof supply and demand meet. The other key points of TA, such as price patterns, are basedon support and resistance points.A support line refers to that level beyond which a stock (or currency pair) price will findbuyers and chances of it (security) will not fall. Therefore, it denotes, the price level atwhich there is a sufficient amount of demand.Similarly, a resistance line refers to that level beyond which a stock (or currency pair)price will find sellers and chances of it (security) will not rise. It indicates the price pointat which there is sufficient amount of supply available to stop and possibly, for a time,turn upward trend.Kinds of TrendsIn the forex market, trends reflect the average rate of change in price over time. Trendsexist in all markets (Equity, FX or commodity) and in all time frames (minutes to multi-years). A trend is one of the most important aspects, which traders need to understand.The traders should analyse which way the market or security (stock, currency pair) isheading and should take position based on that.Following are the different types of trends in the forex market: Sideways trends (range bound) Uptrend (higher lows) Downtrend (lower highs)Sideways TrendsSideways trends indicates that a currency movement is range-bound between levels ofsupport and resistance. It usually occurs when the market does not have a sense ofdirection and ends up consolidating most of the time in this range only.To identify if it is a sideways trend, traders often draw horizontal lines connected by thehighs and lows of the price, which then form resistance and support levels. Clearly, marketparticipants are not sure of which way the market will move and there will be LITTLE orNO rate of price change.38"""""""
"""""""Forex TradingUptrendAn uptrend signifies that the market is heading in the upward direction, creating a bullishmarket. It indicates the price rallies often with intermediate periods of consolidation ormovement (small downward move) against the major (prevailing) trend.An upward trend continues until there is some breakdown in the charts (going down belowsome major support areas). If the market trend is upwards, we need to be cautious ontaking short position (against the overall market trend) on some minor correction in themarket.39Forex TradingAnother way to figure an upward trend of market or currency price is shown below:Above the primary waves move the currency pair (USD/INR) in the direction of the broadertrend (upward move), and secondary waves act as corrective phases (minor correction incurrency, downward) of the primary waves (upward).Downward TrendA downward trend in the forex market is characterized by a price decline in the currencypair (USD/INR), with slight upward swing for a period of consolidation against theprevailing trend (downward trend). Unlike upward trend, a downward trend results in anegative rate of price change over time. In a chart, the price movements indicating adowntrend form a sequence of lower peaks and lower lows.As currency is always traded in pair, the downtrend in forex market is not much affectedas other financial markets. In case of downtrend of a currency pair (USD/INR), the fall inprice of USD gives way to a rise in price of INR. It means something is always going upeven in times of financial or economical downtrend.40Forex TradingAnother way to look at the downward trend figure is in the form of primary (major trend)and secondary (minor correction) wave, as shown in the diagram below.41"""""""
"""""""Forex TradingAnother way to look at the downward trend figure is in the form of primary (major trend)and secondary (minor correction) wave, as shown in the diagram below.41Forex TradingIn the above figure, the primary wave (downtrend) moves the currency pair in the directionof the broader trend (downward trend), and secondary waves (uptrend) act as correctivephases of the primary waves (downtrend).Percentage RetracementA retracement is a secondary wave (temporary reversal) in the direction of a currency thatgoes against the primary wave (major trend).Like all other financial markets, foreign exchange market too does not move straight UPor DOWN, even in the strong trending market (Uptrend or Downtrend market). Traderskeenly watch several percentage retracements, in search of price objective.The amount of prices retreat following a higher-high (or higher-low) can be measuredusing a technique called “percent retracement”. This measures the percentage that prices“retraced”.For example, if a stock price moves from the one year low of INR 50 to a recent high of100 and then retraces back to 75 INR, this backward movement of prices from 100 INR to75 INR (25 INR) retraced 50% of the previous move from 50 INR to 100 INR (100%upward journey).42"""""""
"""""""Forex TradingPercent retracement is strategic for Technical Analysts as based on this they determinethe price levels at which prices will reverse and continue upward afterward. During anystrong bull or bear market, prices often retrace from 33% to 66% of the original move.Retracement of more than 66% nearly signifies an end to the bull market.The TrendlineThe basic principle of technical analysis is that we can identify future trends and to someextent the duration of that trend (upward or downward). During a bull market, we see aseries of higher (upward or primary wave) highs and correction lows (downward orsecondary wave) and in a bear market, lower downswings (primary wave) and correctionhighs (secondary wave).Drawing trendlines correctly is the legitimate extension of identifying the support andresistance levels and providing opportunities to open and close positions.Trendlines are drawn at an angle above or below the price.43"""""""
"""""""Forex TradingThe above chart shows the trendline with downward and upward trends for a EUR/USDcurrency pair. In addition, we can the following in the chart: Three swing highs on the downtrend Three swing lows on the uptrend.Therefore, when drawing trendlines in a downtrend, we draw them above the price andwhen drawing trend lines in an uptrend, we draw them below the price.During a downtrend, it is the high point and in uptrend, it is the low point that willdetermine a trend line.For confirmation, we require at least three swing highs or three swing lows to draw a trendline in either direction (uptrend or downtrend). Higher the number of times the pricetouches a trend line, the more acceptable it is, as more traders are using it for the supportand resistance levels.Using trend lines to tradeMost traders frequently use two methods to trade using trend lines: Entry or exit when the price finds support or resistance at the trend line. Entering when the price breaks through the trend line.Trend line as support or resistanceAs support is equal to demand and resistance signifies supply, it is the imbalance betweensupply and demand, which triggers price movement. If both supply and demand are static,there will be no price movement. Security prices stop falling and reverses whensupport/demand is below the current price. Similarly, security uptrend will stop its upwardjourney when resistance/supply is above the current price.44"""""""

"""""""10. Forex Trading – Technical Strategy Fionrex PTrardiincgePatternsTechnical analysis is based on the assumption that security (e.g. currency pair) pricesmove in trends. In addition, trends do not last forever. They eventually change directionfrom one trend to another. Typically, prices move randomly from decelerate, pause andthen reverse. This change in phases (trends) occurs as traders or investors form newexpectations and by doing so, shift the security (equity or currency pair) supply/demandlines.This change of expectation of traders/investor often causes price patterns to emerge.Price patterns can last for couple of days to multi-months and sometime multi-years also.Price Action PatternsTo understand price action, you need to know how the security or market behaved in thepast. This is followed by observing what is happening in the present and then based onpast and present market behavior; predict where the market will move next.A technical analyst or a trader tries to make a trading decision or suggestion based onrepeated price patterns of past that were once formed, they predict what direction thesecurity or market is most likely to move.The common tools to find price patterns are: chart pattern candlestick patterns trendlines price bands support and resistance levels Fibonacci retracement levels, etc.Because price patterns are technical strategy, we ignore the fundamental analysis – theunderlying factor that moves the market. Nevertheless, if we are dealing with FX trade,this fundamental has a huge impact specially on major economic news announcementslike the Interest Rate decisions from the central bank, Non-Farm Payroll data, FOMC meet,etc.Pattern TypesThe pattern types are divided into two major categories: Continuation pattern Reversal pattern46"""""""
"""""""Forex TradingContinuation PatternsContinuation patterns are used to find opportunities for traders or technical analyst tocontinue with the trend.Generally after a huge price rally, buyers usually close all their long positions, take a pauseto “breath” before starting to buy again. Similarly, after a big drop in prices, sellers willtake a pause and get out of their short position before continuing to sell again. Duringpause after a huge rally or selloff, prices consolidate and end up forming certain patterns.Continuation patterns are said to be complete once the prices break out and continue inthe direction of their prevailing trend (uptrend or downtrend).The most common continuation patterns are: Flags Pennants Triangles Wedges RectanglesReversal PatternsIt shows a transitional phase that points to the turning point between up trending or downtrending market or security.We can consider this as a point where in a downtrend of a market or security, more buyersfind a value attractive (in investing or trading, may be buyers find the fundamentals arenot that weak and its current value is good to buy) and they outweigh the sellers. At theend of uptrend market or security, the reverse process occurs (the sellers outweigh thebuyers).The most important reversal patterns are: Head & Shoulders & Inverse Head and Shoulders Rounding Bottom Double tops and bottoms Triple tops and bottoms Spike (V)Building the Price Pattern RulesA market participant who knows how to use the price action pattern correctly can oftenincrease his performance and his way of looking at charts significantly.Follow these rules while building price patterns:Highs and lowsThe correct analysis of high and low points of a security or market provides informationabout trend strength, trend direction and can even give some hint on the end of trendsand trade price reversal in advance. These high and low points also build the foundation47"""""""
"""""""Forex Tradingof the Dow Theory, which has been around for decades and is a principle commonlypractised by technical analysts.Uptrends – Higher highs and higher lowsA security (stock/ currency) is in uptrend if the highs and lows rise. The rising highs showthat there are more buyers to push the price higher and rising lows show that duringsecurity correction, sellers are losing ground on each correction.A trend changeWhenever we see a market or security price fail to make a new high (previously uptrend)or new low (previously downtrend), it can serve as an early warning signal that a changein direction (trend is breaking) is imminent.Strength of a trend: length and steepness of trend-wavesThe strength of a trend is determined by the trend waves it creates between the highs andlows. The length/size and the steepness of those individual trend waves determine thestrength of a trend.Consider the following chart to understand this:In the above chart, we can see the first trend wave (1) was the longest and very steep.The second trend wave (2) is shorter and less steep and the third trend wave (3) is theshortest and marginally passes the previous high (that shows the saturation point is near,and a trend reversal might happen.). Therefore, we can anticipate the trend reversal(direction) by understanding the concepts of trend-wave length and its steepness.48Forex TradingStrength of trends: depth of pullbacksOnce we have identified the current trend of the market/security, the pullbacks within thattrend can provide valuable information about the future direction.In the above chart, we can see that the major trend (trend line 1) is uptrend with manyconsolidation and retracements (minor trend line – 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

Atthis point, divergence pattern also indicates that the trend is weaker. After the divergencesignal appears, there is a higher chance of reversal, especially if divergence appears on ahigher time frame.Technical IndicatorsThere are various kinds of technical analysis indicators but all have one thing in common;all the indicators use security (equity, currency, commodity etc.) prices (open, high, low,close and volume) in their calculations.We can divide all technical indicator into two main types: Leading Indicators: Leading indicators lead the price movement. These indicatorsgive signal before a new trend or when a reversal occurs. Lagging Indicators: Lagging indicators follow the price action. These indicatorsgive signal after the trend or when a reversal has started.Categories of IndicatorsThe different types of indicators fall under the following categories: Trend Indicators Volume Indicators Momentum Indicators Volatility IndicatorsTrend IndicatorsTrend indicators show traders/investors the trend or direction of the security being traded.A trend can be one of these: Bullish trends (security prices go up with minor downfall). Bearish trends (security prices come down with minor up movement). Sideways trends (security prices are moving in a tight range and not giving anysignal of upward or downward major movement).Note: Security can be an equity (stock), commodity (like gold) or currency (USD).50"""""""

A high volatile security means prices can suddenly move very high or very lowover a short period of time.

This is as per their risk taking capacity (here they can deal with 1% loss & the other99% amount still remains).Risking 1% or less is ideal but if your risk capacity is higher and you have a proven trackrecord, risking 2% is also manageable. Higher than that of 2% is not recommended.For example, on a 1,00,000 INR trading account, risk no more than 1000 INR (1% ofaccount) on single trade.

"""""""in foreign currency like the USD (US dollar) undergo a change in their value, as measuredin domestic currency like the INR (Indian rupees), over a period of time (quarterly ,half-yearly etc.), because of variation in exchange rate. This change in the value of assets andliabilities or cash flows is called the exchange rate risk.So, foreign exchange risk (also called “currency risk”, “FX risk” or “exchange risk”) is afinancial risk that exists when the company financial transaction is done in currency otherthan that of the base currency of the company.This uncertainty about the rate that would prevail on a future date is known as exchangerisk.64"""""""

Forex Trading – Foreign ExchangeF oRrexi TsrakdisngBanks have to face exchange risks because of their activities relating to currency trading,control management of risk on behalf of their clients and risks of their own balance sheetand operations. We can classify these risks into four different categories: Exchange rate risk Credit risk Liquidity risk Operational riskExchange Rate RiskThis relates to the appreciation or depreciation of one currency (for example, the USD) toanother currency (base currency like INR). Every bank has a long or short position in acurrency, depreciation (in case of long position) or appreciation (in case of short position),runs the risk of loss to the bank.This risk mainly affects the businesses but it can also affect individual traders or investorswho make investment exposure.For example, if an Indian has a CD in the United States of America worth 1 million USDollar and the exchange rate is 65 INR: 1 USD, then the Indian effectively has 6,50,00,000INR in the CD. However, if the exchange rate changes significantly to 50 INR: 1 USD, thenthe Indian only has 5,00,00,000 INR in the CD, even though he still has 1 million dollars.Credit RiskCredit risk or default risk is associated with an investment where the borrower is not ableto pay back the amount to the bank or lender. This may be because of poor financialcondition of the borrower and this kind of risk is always there with the borrower.This risk may appear either during the period of contract or at the maturity date.Credit risk management is the practice of avoiding losses by understanding the sufficiencyof a bank’s capital and loan loss reserves at any given time. Credit risk can be reduced byfixing the limits of operations per client, based on the client’s creditworthiness, byincorporating the clauses for overturning the contract if the rating of a counterparty goesdown."""""""

"""""""Forex TradingLiquidity RiskLiquidity refers to how active (buyers and sellers) a market is. Liquidity risk refers to riskof refinancing.Liquidity risk is the probability of loss arising from a situation where - there is not enough cash to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers. the sale of illiquid assets will yield less than their fair value. the sale of illiquid asset is not possible at the desired time due to lack of buyers.Operational RiskThe operational risk is related to the operations of the bank.It is the probability of loss occurring due to internal inadequacies of a bank or a breakdownin its control, operations or procedures.Interest Rate RiskThe interest rate risk is the possibility that the value of an investment (for example, of abank) will decline as a result of an unexpected change in interest rate.Generally, this risk arises on investment in a fixed-rate bond. When the interest rate rises,the market value of the bond declines, since the rate being paid on the bond is now lowerthan the current market rate. Therefore, the investor will be less inclined to buy the bondas the market price of the bond goes down with a demand decline in the market. The lossis only realized once the bond is sold or reaches its maturity date.Higher interest rate risk is associated with long-term bonds, as there may be many yearswithin which an adverse interest rate fluctuation can occur.Interest rate risk can be minimized either by diversifying the investment across a broadmix of security types or by hedging. In case of hedging, an investor can enter into aninterest rate swap.Country RiskCountry risk refers to the risk of investing or lending possibly due to economic and/orpolitical environment in the buyer’s country, which may result in an inability to pay forimports.Following table lists down the countries, which have lower risks when it comes toinvestment:Rank Rank Change (from previous year) Country Overall Score(out of 100)"""""""

If you lose too much money, you will be out of the game soon and if youmake too much (then you anticipated) money, then because of your over-confidence, youwill do over-trading and loose most of what you gain.Limit your lossesYou should have an exit plan before you enter any trade. You should have strict stop lossin case trade is not going in your favour. If your trade is with the trend, you should readjustyour stop losses and hold onto your profit. In order to keep these nightmares (your losses)from occurring, a trader should follow strict stop loss and exit the trade in case of losingtrades before they turn into disasters.Hold on to your profitsMany traders have no problem cutting losses but they also insist on exiting trades at thefirst sign of profits. However, they eventually see that their small profits could turn hugeif they hold onto their position for little longer. The strategy here should be – “cut yourlosses and hold onto your gains”.Trading strategyA good trading strategy is required. However, money management is also very important.Your trade risk should not be more than 2% of your account in each trade.Listen to the charts (technical indicators)Everything is reflected in the price and volume when it comes to technical analysis.
